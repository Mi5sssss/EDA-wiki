### Process Design Kit (PDK)
+ [SkyWater Open Source PDK](https://github.com/google/skywater-pdk) (Google, SkyWater)
  - The SkyWater Open Source PDK is a collaboration between Google and SkyWater Technology Foundry to provide a fully open source Process Design Kit and related resources, which can be used to create manufacturable designs at SkyWater’s facility.
+ [Libre Silicon](https://libresilicon.com/)
  - We develop a free (as in freedom, not as in free of charge) and open source semiconductor manufacturing process standard, including a full mixed signal PDK, and provide a quick, easy and inexpensive way for manufacturing.
+ [ASAP](http://asap.asu.edu/asap/) (Arizona State, ARM), "available for non-commercial academic use for free"
  - The PDK contains SPICE-compatible FinFET device models (BSIM-CMG), Technology files for Cadence Virtuoso, Design Rule Checker (DRC), Layout vs Schematic Checker (LVS) and Extraction Deck for the 7nm technology node.
+ [FreePDK](https://www.eda.ncsu.edu/wiki/FreePDK) (NCSU)
  - An open-source, Open-Access-based PDK for the 45nm technology node and the Predictive Technology Model.

### Standard Cell Libraries
- [DesignStart Physical IP](https://developer.arm.com/ip-products/designstart/physical-ip) (ARM)
  - The most comprehensive physical IP with no upfront fees – for companies to produce commercial silicon or for universities to research
- [Open-Cell](http://www.si2.org/open-cell-library/) (Si2)
  - Silvaco's 15nm Open-Cell Library
  - No charge for universities and Si2 members
- [LibreCell](https://codeberg.org/tok/librecell), under [GNU General Public License v3.0](https://codeberg.org/tok/librecell/src/branch/master/librecell-common/LICENSE), [CERN Open Hardware Licence v2.0](https://codeberg.org/tok/librecell/src/branch/master/librecell-layout/LICENCE), and [GNU Affero General Public License v3.0](https://codeberg.org/tok/librecell/src/branch/master/librecell-lib/LICENSE)
  - Aims to be a toolbox for automated synthesis of CMOS logic cells.

### Hardware Functional Libraries
+ [FloPoCo](http://flopoco.gforge.inria.fr/)
  - A generator of arithmetic cores (Floating-Point Cores, but not only) for FPGAs (but not only).
+ [HLSLibs](https://hlslibs.org/) (Mentor)
  - A free and open set of libraries implemented in standard C++ for bit-accurate hardware and software design.
+ [MatchLib](https://github.com/NVlabs/matchlib) (NVIDIA)
  - MatchLib is a SystemC/C++ library of commonly-used hardware functions and components that can be synthesized by most commercially-available HLS tools into RTL.
+ [HiFlipVX](https://github.com/TUD-ADS/HiFlipVX)
  - Open Source High-Level Synthesis FPGA Library for Image Processing.

### PDK for CNTFET
- Variation-Aware [Nanosystem Design Kit (NDK)](https://nanohub.org/resources/22582) (Stanford)
  - A framework that quickly evaluates the impact of CNT variations on circuit delay and noise margin, and systematically explores the large space of CNT processing options to derive optimized CNT processing and CNFET circuit design guidelines.

### PDK for Silicon Photonics
- [SiEPIC EBeam PDK](https://github.com/SiEPIC/SiEPIC_EBeam_PDK) (UBC), under [MIT License](https://github.com/SiEPIC/SiEPIC_EBeam_PDK/blob/master/LICENSE.md)
  - For silicon photonics layout, design, verification and circuit simulation.
